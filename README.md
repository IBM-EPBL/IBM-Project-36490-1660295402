A Gesture-based Tool for Sterile Browsing of Radiology Images
                          Problem Statement:
                                            Humans are able to recognize body and sign language easily.
                         This is possible due to the combination of vision and synaptic interactions that were formed along brain development.
                         In order to replicate this skill in computers, some problems need to be solved: how to separate objects of interest in images and which image capture technology and classification technique are more appropriate, among others.
